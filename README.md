Hello!

Welcome to my Productive Plant Project.

This is the Front-end to show you a demo of how the application is going to look like. 

The framework is VUE.js with using HTML and JS code. 

The application starts off with a plant that has a health of 100 and a name (future can allow the users to set the name with what they want it to be)

Have to create at least 3 objectives before the game can start.

Have the check and uncheck button to show if the objective has been done or not. 

There an end of day button, so when the day is done you press this button. If all the objectives are not done, this will impact 25 in damage to the plants health. If all objectives are met then this will regenerate the plants health by 5. If the plants health is already at full capacity then it will sustain at 100. 

There is future plans for this project that is going to bring this beginning demo to hopefully and fully develop app to help daily productivity within peoples lives. 

Why?

This project aims to help productiveness throughout your daily life.

Instead of planning way ahead and forgetting about what is in front of you, I am looking to build Productive Plant to help be productive in the moment.

Therefore, making sure to be productive today to lessen the load for tomorrow! No matter the size of the objective, longest it's an objective, it is better than nothing.

The plant represents the state of your mind. As long as you keep the health 100% by completing your objectives, this will reduce your workload and hopefully the stress/anxiety that follows when the workload is too heavy to carry!

This has the potential to become something great, as well as treated as a 'break' from focusing too much, that you get to reflect on what you have achieved, rather than just focusing on what you have left to do all the time.

MVP:

User starts of with a plant.

The plant has full health and an option to be named anything the user wants it to be.

User has to set a minimum of 3 objectives/goals.

As User completes an objective, they can water the plant.

If the User has any objectives left over by the end of the day, the amount of objectives left over determines the amount of damage to the plant.

Bonus:

Can add timed objectives, an objective to complete in the Morning, Afternoon and Night.

If missed, then this can cause damage to the plant.

Include health regen, so if the User completes all their objectives by the end of each day, the plant recieves health.
